                            content creators. Through tokenization, users can directly monetize their videos, receive
                            tips from viewers, participate
                            in revenue-sharing models, or explore sponsorship opportunities. This allows creators to
                            have greater control over their
                            monetization strategies.

                            broader financial landscape. Here are some key advantages of a utilitybased decentralized
                            paying application:</p>
                        <p class="banner-des" style="text-align: justify;"> <b>Financial Inclusion:</b>
                            A decentralized paying application can facilitate financial inclusion by allowing anyone
                            with a
                            smartphone and internet access to participate in the digital economy. Users can have access

                            for intermediaries, such as banks or payment processors. Users can send and receive payments
                            directly, reducing
                            transaction costs and eliminating the need for third-party approval.

                            have a say in the platform's rules and decision-making processes. Users can participate in

                            collaboration within the financial
                            ecosystem. Developers can build on top of the decentralized infrastructure, creating new
