                                              and supporters. Players who participate in the pre-sale phase

                                              providing valuable feedback during the development process.
                                              This engagement helps foster a strong community and increases

                                              prices, bonus items, or special privileges. These incentivesencourage players to participate in the pre-sale and provide

                                            Public utility games are strategic interaction models that are used to
analyze and understand the dynamics of public utility systems.
These games involve multiple players who make decisions that
impact the overall utility or welfare of the public
In public utility games, players are typically responsible for
managing or allocating resources in a way that maximizes the
collective benefit for society. The objective is to find an equilibrium or
solution that optimizes the overall utility while considering the
preferences and actions of each player.
